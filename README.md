2019 - Spring Project UE4 4.22

### Background
This project was my first real project in Unreal. I had used it before, but only in a classroom setting and never for the purpose of developing a playable game.
This project was designed as a twin-stick like shooter with a weapon swap system and was meant to showcase and grow everyone's skills.

The project did not reach fruition due to conflicts in personal schedules leading to the game falling exponentially behind schedule.
Regardless of the outcome, I am still exceptionally proud of this project. It was my first experience with Unreal Engine, my first experience with Unreal Engine and git, and my first time using Jira.
I learned so much over the 3 months that I worked on this game and I feel that I accomplished a lot in the face of the steep learning curve.

### What I'm Proud of
1. I was happy with the sheer ability to begin learning UE4. This project really made me fall in love with the engine.
2. I liked my weapon system. It was fairly scalable, which could have helped with development time.

### What I'd Change
1. Due to the nature of my learning curve, my code is pretty bad. I would have definately organized it better.
2. I would have moved more things to cpp. Really as many systems as possible.
3. I would have tried to develop better tools for the team to better implement the systems quickly and easily.
4. Finally, the whole thing is pretty unoptomized, but since it's a pretty small game, it's not super noticable. I definately would have taken the time to refactor the code.
