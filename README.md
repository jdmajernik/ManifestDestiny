2019 - Spring Project UE4 4.22

### Background
This project was my first real project in Unreal. I had used it before, but only in a classroom setting and never for the purpose of developing a playable game.
This project was designed as a twin-stick like shooter with a weapon swap system and was meant to showcase and grow everyone's skills.

The project did not reach fruition due to conflicts in personal schedules leading to the game falling exponentially behind schedule.
Regardless of the outcome, I am still exceptionally proud of this project. It was my first experience with Unreal Engine, my first experience with Unreal Engine and git, and my first time using Jira.
I learned so much over the 3 months that I worked on this game and I feel that I accomplished a lot in the face of the steep learning curve.
